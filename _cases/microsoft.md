Interned over two consecutive summers on the O365 UX framework team. As a SDE intern, I implemented web controls into the MVC framework, reviewed accessibility bugs, and shipped production code currently live on O365 products. One of my final projects involved developing a screensaver application to execute unit tests on idle computers.
