Worked as a front end engineer on Socrata's various web products.  My role on the front end team was practically indistinguishable from a normal full time developer.  I worked on different stories, features, improvements, and bugs primarily on Socrata's Data Lens platform.  I also planned iteration commits, contributed to feature estimation, and participated in bi-monthly retrospective meetings.
