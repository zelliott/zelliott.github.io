Worked on a new machine learning/data analytics startup. Two of my main projects involved leading the front end development on two dashboards for the nonprofit company Thorn.  The designs for both dashboards were built from scratch.  Collaborated closely with representatives from Thorn to understand use cases and develop specs.
