After pitching a new esports startup idea on Reddit, I connected virtually with a CS student living in Mumbai, and together we worked to build a mockup of the web app.  GGDeck is a professional esports network, where talented players can connect with international teams.  It's like a LinkedIn for the stereotypically non-professional realm of esports.
