Founded a new question-answer app built on a social gamification framework. Lead the front-end development and business-aspect of Junglr, and learned a ton about teamwork, project management, and marketing.  At its peak, Junglr had ~100 active users (users posting daily).  With such a small userbase, my co-founders and I were able to quickly act on feedback from the community, which allowed for a rapidly iterative development process.
