My sophomore year, while studying for various tech interviews, I struggled to find a central resource for good practice CS questions.  Consequently, I decided to build such a resource (and become more aquainted with the MEAN stack in the process).


Intquest (**int**-erview **quest**-ions) is a web application that helps you quickly study computer science concepts for interviews. Users post, answer, and review interview questions sorted by concept.  What makes it different from other resources (Stack Overflow, Quora, Google, etc...)?  Intquest just compiles a bunch of questions. Jumping from site to site to practice interview questions is the worst. You should be able to select the concepts you need to practice and immediately begin prepping.
